# Scene Generation AI


This project utilizes AI to seamlessly integrate furniture product images with appropriate backgrounds, enhancing visual representation on e-commerce platforms like Leroy Merlin. By automating the process of generating realistic product environments, it eliminates the need for costly and time-consuming photoshoots or complex 3D rendering. This innovation enables users to visualize furniture in context, aiding in better purchasing decisions and improving overall customer satisfaction.

The tool is crucial for furniture marketplaces, online retailers, and e-commerce platforms aiming to enhance user engagement and streamline product display processes. It caters to both sellers, who benefit from reduced operational costs and improved visual appeal of their offerings, and buyers, who gain a clearer understanding of how products fit into their living spaces or desired environments before making a purchase.
